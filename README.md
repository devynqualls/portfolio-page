## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devynqualls/portfolio-page.git
cd portfolio-page
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
